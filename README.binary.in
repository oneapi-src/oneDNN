Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL)
==================================

Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL) is an
open-source performance library for deep learning applications. The library
includes basic building blocks for neural networks optimized
for Intel Architecture Processors and Intel Processor Graphics.

This package contains DNNL v@PROJECT_VERSION@ (@DNNL_VERSION_HASH@).

You can find information about the latest version and release notes
at DNNL Github (https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/releases).

Documentation
-------------

* Developer guide (https://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/v@DNNL_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DNNL_VERSION_MINOR@)
explains programming model, supported functionality, details of primitives
implementations and includes annotated examples.
* API reference (https://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/v@DNNL_VERSION_MAJOR@.@DNNL_VERSION_MINOR@/modules.html)
provides comprehensive reference of the library API.

System Requirements
-------------------

DNNL supports systems based on Intel 64 architecture or
compatible processors.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel Atom processor with Intel SSE4.1 support
* 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th generation Intel Core(TM) processor
* Intel Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
  Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
* Intel Xeon Phi(TM) processor (formerly Knights Landing and Knights Mill)
* Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake and Cascade Lake)
* future Intel Xeon Scalable processor (code name Cooper Lake)

DNNL detects instruction set architecture (ISA) in the runtime and uses
just-in-time (JIT) code generation to deploy the code optimized
for the latest supported ISA.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel HD Graphics
* Intel UHD Graphics
* Intel Iris Plus Graphics
