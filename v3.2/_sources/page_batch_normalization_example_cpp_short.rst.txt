==========

This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Batch Normalization <doxid-dev_guide_batch_normalization>` primitive in forward training propagation mode.

This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Batch Normalization <doxid-dev_guide_batch_normalization>` primitive in forward training propagation mode.

Key optimizations included in this example:

* In-place primitive execution;

* Source memory format for an optimized primitive implementation;

* Fused post-ops via operation descriptor flags;
