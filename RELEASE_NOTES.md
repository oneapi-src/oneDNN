## NVIDIA GPUs
  * Improved matmul performance using cuBLASLt-based implementation.

# Functionality

## Common
  * Introduced support for `select` algorithm in binary primitive. The functionality is optimized for Intel CPUs.
  * Extended quantization support in matmul and reorder with grouped scales and zero-points for weights. This functionality is optimized for Intel CPUs and GPUs.
  * Introduced initial support for 4-bit floating-point data types `f4_e2m1` and `f4_e3m0` in matmul and reorder, as well as `e8m0` scales data type in matmul and reorder. This functionality is available on Intel CPUs and GPUs.
  * Introduced [`GenIndex`], and [`GreaterEqual`] operations in Graph API.

## Intel Architecture Processors
  * Introduced support for `fp32` matmul with `fp16` and `bf16` weights.

## Intel Graphics Products
  * Introduced stochastic rounding support for convolution, matmul and reorder based on Philox counter-based random number generator.
  * Introduced support for strided memory formats in convolution.

## Generic GPU vendor
  * Introduced support for reduction primitive.
  * Introduced support for inner product primitive forward propagation.

# Usability

## Common
  * With the SYCL runtime, memory objects on the CPU engine are now reference-counted and no longer need to be explicitly kept alive for the duration of the primitive execution. This aligns memory object lifetime behavior on CPU and GPU engines.
  * Added Graph API examples for [Gated MLP] and [`int4` Gated MLP] patterns.

## Intel Architecture Processors
  * Improved verbose diagnostics to better identify issues during dispatching, primitive and kernel creation for Intel CPU and Intel GPU implementations.
  * Enabled frame pointers support on Intel64 platforms to improve integration with profilers.

## Intel Processor Graphics
  * Improved verbose diagnostics for Intel GPU driver compatibility issues.
  * Improved support of large size tensors in convolution, matmul and reduction primitives on Intel GPUs.
  * Reduced scratchpad usage for NCHW convolution on Intel GPUs.

# Validation
  * Extended benchdnn with support and validation for fp8 matmul patterns for tensor tags in RNN primitive validation.
  * Extended benchdnn with support for rewriting data types in the test JSON files in the graph driver.
  * Extended benchdnn with support and validation for the number of partitions returned from the test JSON files.

# Deprecated Functionality
  * Experimental [Graph Compiler] is deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

[Graph Compiler]: https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v3.7/dev_guide_graph_compiler.html

# Breaking Changes
  * Updated minimal supported CMake version to 3.13 (was 2.8.12).
  * Updated minimal supported GCC version to 8.0 (was 4.8).
  * Updated minimal supported Clang version to 11.0 (was 3.0).
  * Removed support for SYCL older than 2020.
  * Enforced `fp32` accumulation mode in `fp16` matmul and inner product primitives on Intel Graphics products without Intel XMX cores. Previous behavir can be enabled with relaxed [accumulation mode].
