/// Full example text: @ref sycl_interop_buffer.cpp
///
/// This C++ API example demonstrates programming for Intel(R) Processor
/// Graphics with SYCL extensions API in oneDNN.
/// The workflow includes following steps:
///   - Create a GPU or CPU engine. It uses DPC++ as the runtime in this sample.
///   - Create a memory descriptor/object.
///   - Create a SYCL kernel for data initialization.
///   - Access a SYCL buffer via SYCL interoperability interface.
///   - Access a SYCL queue via SYCL interoperability interface.
///   - Execute a SYCL kernel with related SYCL queue and SYCL buffer
///   - Create operation descriptor/operation primitives descriptor/primitive.
///   - Execute the primitive with the initialized memory.
///   - Validate the result through a host accessor.

/// To start using oneDNN, we must first include the @ref dnnl.hpp
/// header file in the application. We also include CL/sycl.hpp from DPC++ for
/// using SYCL APIs and @ref dnnl_debug.h, which  contains some debugging
/// facilities such as returning a string representation
/// for common oneDNN C types.
/// All C++ API types and functions reside in the `dnnl` namespace, and
/// SYCL API types and functions reside in the `cl::sycl` namespace.
/// For simplicity of the example we import both namespaces.

    ///
    /// All oneDNN primitives and memory objects are attached to a
    /// particular @ref dnnl::engine, which is an abstraction of a
    /// computational device (see also @ref dev_guide_basic_concepts). The
    /// primitives are created and optimized for the device to which they are
    /// attached, and the memory objects refer to memory residing on the
    /// corresponding device. In particular, that means neither memory objects
    /// nor primitives that were created for one engine can be used on
    /// another.
    ///
    /// To create engines, we must specify the @ref dnnl::engine::kind
    /// and the index of the device of the given kind. In this example we use
    /// the first available GPU or CPU engine, so the index for the engine is 0.
    /// This example assumes DPC++ being a runtime. In such case,
    /// during engine creation, an SYCL context is also created and attaches
    /// to the created engine.

    /// for the execution. The stream encapsulates an execution context and is
    /// tied to a particular engine.
    ///
    /// In this example, a stream is created.
    /// This example assumes DPC++ being a runtime. During stream creation,
    /// a SYCL queue is also created and attaches to this stream.
