/**
 * @file
 * @brief Defines some data types that are native to various x86-64 ISAs.
 *
 * x86-64 types can be defined according using a number of reasonable
 * taxonomies. The taxonomy we define here is guided by the following goals:
 *
 * - Standard. The mapping between our type taxonomy, and the taxonomies used
 *   in certain standard documentation is intuitive. The documentation guiding
 *   our taxonomy is:
 *
 *   - "Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual"
 *     (especially Volume 1 Section 4). Abbreviated "SDM".
 *
 *   - (maintained here: https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI).
 *     Abbreviated "psABI".
 *
 * - Simple. Our taxonomy only covers that data types required by the
 *   Graphcompiler's Xbyak JIT engine. This means:
 *
 *   - There are some datatypes defined in the standard documentation
 *     (e.g. 80-bit x87 floats) that are simply omitted from our taxonomy.
 *
 *   - There may be some datatypes that other documentation treats as distinct,
 *     but our taxonomy treats as a single type. E.g., {__m128i, __m128u} vs.
 *     simply {__m128}.
 *
 * - Flat / denormalized. The Manual defines a
 *   type hierarchy with several levels: numeric data type, fundamental data
 *   type, etc. In cases where such distinctions are needed by our taxonomy,
 *   we add columns as needed to our one and only type table, rather than
 *   adding more tables.
 *
 * - Combined CPU + ABI. The data types, and the data-type table, contains
 *   all of our tabular information for x86-64 ISA *and* psABI.
 *
 *   (If/when we support additional ABIs for this ISA, it may be reasonable to
 *   separate the ABI-specific information into separate, per-ABI tables.)
