This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Convolution <doxid-dev_guide_convolution>` primitive in forward propagation mode in two configurations - with and without groups.

This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Convolution <doxid-dev_guide_convolution>` primitive in forward propagation mode in two configurations - with and without groups.

Key optimizations included in this example:

* Creation of optimized memory format from the primitive descriptor;

* Primitive attributes with fused post-ops.
