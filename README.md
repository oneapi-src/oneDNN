[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
oneDNN project is part of the [UXL Foundation] and is an implementation
of the [oneAPI specification] for oneDNN component.

The library is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture Processors, Intel Graphics,
and Arm(R) 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)-based processors. oneDNN has
experimental support for the following architectures: NVIDIA\* GPU,
AMD\* GPU, OpenPOWER\* Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz\* (s390x), and RISC-V.

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance on CPUs and GPUs.
Deep learning practitioners should use one of the
[applications enabled with oneDNN](#applications-enabled-with-onednn).

# Installation

Binary distribution of this software is available in:
* [Anaconda]
* [Intel oneAPI]

The packages do not include library dependencies and these need to be resolved
in the application at build time. See the [System Requirements] section below
and the [Build Options] section in the [Developer Guide] for more details on
CPU and GPU runtimes.

If the configuration you need is not available, you can
[build the library from source][Build from Source].

# System Requirements

oneDNN supports platforms based on the following architectures:
- [Intel 64 or AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64),
- [Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile).
- [OpenPOWER](https://openpowerfoundation.org/) / [IBM Power ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA).
- [IBMz z/Architecture (s390x)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture).
- [RISC-V 64-bit (RV64)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V).

> **WARNING**
>
> Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz (s390x), and RISC-V (RV64) support is
> **experimental** with limited testing validation.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel 64/AMD64 architecture
  * Intel Atom(R) processor (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
  * Intel Core(TM) processor (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
  * Intel Core Ultra processors (formerly Meteor Lake)
  * Intel Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
    Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
  * Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake, Cascade Lake, Cooper
    Lake, Ice Lake, Sapphire Rapids, and Emerald Rapids)
  * Intel Xeon CPU Max Series (formerly Sapphire Rapids HBM)
  * future Intel Xeon Scalable processors (code name Sierra Forest
and Granite Rapids)
* AArch64 architecture
  * Arm Neoverse(TM) N1 and V1 processors

On a CPU based on Intel 64 or on AMD64 architecture, oneDNN detects
the instruction set architecture (ISA) at runtime and uses just-in-time (JIT)
code generation to deploy the code optimized for the latest supported ISA.
Future ISAs may have initial support in the library disabled by default and
require the use of run-time controls to enable them. See
[CPU dispatcher control] for more details.


> **WARNING**
>
> On macOS, applications that use oneDNN may need to request special
> entitlements if they use the hardened runtime. See the
> [Linking Guide] for more details.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel Graphics for 11th-14th Generation Intel Core Processors
* Intel Graphics for Intel Core Ultra processors (formerly Meteor Lake)
* Intel Iris Xe MAX Graphics (formerly DG1)
* Intel Arc(TM) graphics (formerly Alchemist)
* Intel Data Center GPU Flex Series (formerly Arctic Sound)
* Intel Data Center GPU Max Series (formerly Ponte Vecchio)

### CPU Engine

oneDNN CPU engine is used to execute primitives on Intel Architecture
Processors, 64-bit Arm Architecture (AArch64) processors,
64-bit Power ISA (PPC64) processors, IBMz (s390x), and compatible devices.

The CPU engine is built by default but can be disabled at build time by setting
`DNNL_CPU_RUNTIME` to `NONE`. In this case, GPU engine must be enabled.
The CPU engine can be configured to use the OpenMP, TBB or SYCL runtime.
The following additional requirements apply:
* OpenMP runtime requires C++ compiler with OpenMP 2.0 or later
  standard support
* TBB runtime requires [Threading Building Blocks (TBB)] 2017 or later.
* SYCL runtime requires
  * [Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler]
  * [Threading Building Blocks (TBB)]

Some implementations rely on OpenMP 4.0 SIMD extensions. For the best
performance results on Intel Architecture Processors we recommend using the
Intel C++ Compiler.

[Threading Building Blocks (TBB)]: https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/
[Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler]: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/dpc-compiler.html

On a CPU based on Arm AArch64 architecture, oneDNN CPU engine can be built with
[Arm Compute Library (ACL)] integration. ACL is an open-source library for
machine learning applications and provides AArch64 optimized implementations
of core functions. This functionality currently requires that ACL is downloaded
and built separately. See [Build from Source] section of the Developer Guide for
details. oneDNN only supports Compute Library versions 24.04 or later.

[Arm Compute Library (ACL)]: https://github.com/arm-software/ComputeLibrary

### GPU Engine

Intel Processor Graphics and Xe Architecture graphics are supported by
the oneDNN GPU engine. The GPU engine is disabled in the default build
configuration. The following additional requirements apply when GPU engine
is enabled:
* OpenCL runtime requires
    * OpenCL\* runtime library (OpenCL version 1.2 or later)
    * OpenCL driver (with kernel language support for OpenCL C 2.0 or later)
      with Intel subgroups and USM extensions support
* SYCL runtime requires
    * [Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler]
    * OpenCL runtime library (OpenCL version 3.0 or later)
    * [oneAPI Level Zero]
* SYCL runtime with NVIDIA GPU support requires
    * [oneAPI DPC++ Compiler with support for CUDA] or [oneAPI for NVIDIA GPUs]
    * NVIDIA CUDA\* driver
    * cuBLAS 10.1 or later
    * cuDNN 7.6 or later
* SYCL runtime with AMD GPU support requires
    * [oneAPI DPC++ Compiler with support for HIP AMD] or [oneAPI for AMD GPUs]
    * [AMD ROCm] version 5.3 or later
    * [MIOpen] version 2.18 or later (optional if AMD ROCm includes the required
    version of MIOpen)
    * [rocBLAS] version 2.45.0 or later (optional if AMD ROCm includes
    the required version of rocBLAS)

> **WARNING**
>
> Linux will reset GPU when kernel runtime exceeds several seconds. The user
> can prevent this behavior by [disabling hangcheck] for Intel GPU driver.
> Windows has built-in [timeout detection and recovery] mechanism that results
> in similar behavior. The user can prevent this behavior by increasing the
> [TdrDelay] value.

> **WARNING**
>
> NVIDIA GPU support is experimental. General information, build instructions,
> and implementation limitations are available in the
> [NVIDIA backend readme](src/gpu/nvidia/README.md).

> **WARNING**

> AMD GPU support is experimental. General information, build instructions,
