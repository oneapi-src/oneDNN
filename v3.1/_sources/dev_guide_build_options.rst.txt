All building options listed support their counterparts with ``DNNL`` prefix instead of ``ONEDNN``. ``DNNL`` options would take precedence over ``ONEDNN`` versions, if both versions are specified.

All other building options or values that can be found in CMake files are intended for development/debug purposes and are subject to change without notice. Please avoid using them.

Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Host compiler
-------------

When building oneDNN with oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler user can specify a custom host compiler. The host compiler is a compiler that will be used by the main compiler driver to perform host compilation step.

The host compiler can be specified with ``ONEDNN_DPCPP_HOST_COMPILER`` CMake option. It should be specified either by name (in this case, the standard system environment variables will be used to discover it) or an absolute path to the compiler executable.

The default value of ``ONEDNN_DPCPP_HOST_COMPILER`` is ``DEFAULT``, which is the default host compiler used by the compiler specified with ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``.

The ``DEFAULT`` host compiler is the only supported option on Windows. On Linux, user can specify a GNU C++ compiler as the host compiler.

.. warning:: 

   oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler requires host compiler to be compatible. The minimum allowed GNU C++ compiler version is 7.4.0. See `GCC* Compatibility and Interoperability <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-dpcpp-cpp-compiler-dev-guide-and-reference/top/compatibility-and-portability/gcc-compatibility-and-interoperability.html>`__ section in oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler Developer Guide.
   
   


Configuring functionality
-------------------------

Using ``ONEDNN_ENABLE_WORKLOAD`` and ``ONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE`` it is possible to limit functionality available in the final shared object or statically linked application. This helps to reduce the amount of disk space occupied by an app.

ONEDNN_ENABLE_WORKLOAD
++++++++++++++++++++++

This option supports only two values: ``TRAINING`` (the default) and ``INFERENCE``. ``INFERENCE`` enables only forward propagation kind part of functionality, removing all backward-related functionality, except those which are dependencies for forward propagation kind part.

ONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This option supports several values: ``ALL`` (the default) which enables all primitives implementations or a set of ``BATCH_NORMALIZATION``, ``BINARY``, ``CONCAT``, ``CONVOLUTION``, ``DECONVOLUTION``, ``ELTWISE``, ``INNER_PRODUCT``, ``LAYER_NORMALIZATION``, ``LRN``, ``MATMUL``, ``POOLING``, ``PRELU``, ``REDUCTION``, ``REORDER``, ``RESAMPLING``, ``RNN``, ``SHUFFLE``, ``SOFTMAX``, ``SUM``. When a set is used, only those selected primitives implementations will be available. Attempting to use other primitive implementations will end up returning an unimplemented status when creating primitive descriptor. In order to specify a set, a CMake-style string should be used, with semicolon delimiters, as in this example:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	-DONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE=CONVOLUTION;MATMUL;REORDER

ONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE_CPU_ISA
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This option supports several values: ``ALL`` (the default) which enables all ISA implementations or one of ``SSE41``, ``AVX2``, ``AVX512``, and ``AMX``. Values are linearly ordered as ``SSE41`` <``AVX2`` <``AVX512`` <``AMX``. When specified, selected ISA and all ISA that are "smaller" will be available. Example that enables SSE41 and AVX2 sets:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	-DONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE_CPU_ISA=AVX2

ONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE_GPU_ISA
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This option supports several values: ``ALL`` (the default) which enables all ISA implementations or any set of ``GEN9``, ``GEN11``, ``XELP``, ``XEHP``, ``XEHPG`` and ``XEHPC``. Selected ISA will enable correspondent parts in just-in-time kernel generation based implementations. OpenCL based kernels and implementations will always be available. Example that enables XeLP and XeHP set:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	-DONEDNN_ENABLE_PRIMITIVE_GPU_ISA=XELP;XEHP

CPU Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

Intel Architecture Processors and compatible devices are supported by oneDNN CPU engine. The CPU engine is built by default but can be disabled at build time by setting ``ONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME`` to ``NONE``. In this case, GPU engine must be enabled.

Targeting Specific Architecture
-------------------------------

oneDNN uses JIT code generation to implement most of its functionality and will choose the best code based on detected processor features. However, some oneDNN functionality will still benefit from targeting a specific processor architecture at build time. You can use ``ONEDNN_ARCH_OPT_FLAGS`` CMake option for this.

For Intel(R) C++ Compilers, the default option is ``-xSSE4.1``, which instructs the compiler to generate the code for the processors that support SSE4.1 instructions. This option would not allow you to run the library on older processor architectures.

For GNU\* Compilers and Clang, the default option is ``-msse4.1``.

.. warning:: 

   While use of ``ONEDNN_ARCH_OPT_FLAGS`` option gives better performance, the resulting library can be run only on systems that have instruction set compatible with the target instruction set. Therefore, ``ARCH_OPT_FLAGS`` should be set to an empty string (``""``) if the resulting library needs to be portable.
   
   


Runtime CPU dispatcher control
------------------------------

oneDNN JIT relies on ISA features obtained from the processor it is being run on. There are situations when it is necessary to control this behavior at run-time to, for example, test SSE4.1 code on an AVX2-capable processor. The ``ONEDNN_ENABLE_MAX_CPU_ISA`` build option controls the availability of this feature. See :ref:`CPU Dispatcher Control <doxid-dev_guide_cpu_dispatcher_control>` for more information.

Runtime CPU ISA hints
---------------------

For performance reasons, sometimes oneDNN JIT needs to be provided with extra hints so as to prefer or avoid particular CPU ISA feature. For example, one might want to disable Zmm registers usage in order to take advantage of higher clock speed. The ``ONEDNN_ENABLE_CPU_ISA_HINTS`` build option makes this feature available at runtime. See :ref:`CPU ISA Hints <doxid-dev_guide_cpu_isa_hints>` for more information.

Runtimes
--------

CPU engine can use OpenMP, Threading Building Blocks (TBB) or sequential threading runtimes. OpenMP threading is the default build mode. This behavior is controlled by the ``ONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME`` CMake option.

OpenMP
++++++

oneDNN uses OpenMP runtime library provided by the compiler.

When building oneDNN with oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler the library will link to Intel OpenMP runtime. This behavior can be changed by changing the host compiler with ``ONEDNN_DPCPP_HOST_COMPILER`` option.

.. warning:: 

   Because different OpenMP runtimes may not be binary-compatible, it's important to ensure that only one OpenMP runtime is used throughout the application. Having more than one OpenMP runtime linked to an executable may lead to undefined behavior including incorrect results or crashes. However as long as both the library and the application use the same or compatible compilers there would be no conflicts.
   
   


Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To build oneDNN with TBB support, set ``ONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME`` to ``TBB`` :

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=TBB ..

Optionally, set the ``TBBROOT`` environmental variable to point to the TBB installation path or pass the path directly to CMake:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=TBB -DTBBROOT=/opt/intel/path/tbb ..

oneDNN has functional limitations if built with TBB:

* Winograd convolution algorithm is not supported for fp32 backward by data and backward by weights propagation.

Threadpool
++++++++++

To build oneDNN with support for threadpool threading, set ``ONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME`` to ``THREADPOOL``

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=THREADPOOL ..

The ``_ONEDNN_TEST_THREADPOOL_IMPL`` CMake variable controls which of the three threadpool implementations would be used for testing: ``STANDALONE``, ``TBB``, or ``EIGEN``. The latter two require also passing ``TBBROOT`` or ``Eigen3_DIR`` paths to CMake. For example:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_CPU_RUNTIME=THREADPOOL -D_ONEDNN_TEST_THREADPOOL_IMPL=EIGEN -DEigen3_DIR=/path/to/eigen/share/eigen3/cmake ..

Threadpool threading support is experimental and has the same limitations as TBB plus more:

* As threadpools are attached to streams which are only passed during primitive execution, work decomposition is performed statically at the primitive creation time. At the primitive execution time, the threadpool is responsible for balancing the static decomposition from the previous item across available worker threads.

oneDNN includes experimental support for Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64). By default, AArch64 builds will use the reference implementations throughout. The following options enable the use of AArch64 optimised implementations for a limited number of operations, provided by AArch64 libraries.

Arm Compute Library
+++++++++++++++++++

Arm Compute Library is an open-source library for machine learning applications. The development repository is available from `mlplatform.org <https://review.mlplatform.org/#/admin/projects/ml/ComputeLibrary>`__, and releases are also available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary>`__. The ``ONEDNN_AARCH64_USE_ACL`` CMake option is used to enable Compute Library integration:

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_AARCH64_USE_ACL=ON ..

This assumes that the environment variable ``ACL_ROOT_DIR`` is set to the location of Arm Compute Library, which must be downloaded and built independently of oneDNN.

.. warning:: 

   For a debug build of oneDNN it is advisable to specify a Compute Library build which has also been built with debug enabled.
   
   

.. warning:: 

   oneDNN only supports builds with Compute Library v22.08 or later.
   
   


Vendor BLAS libraries
+++++++++++++++++++++

oneDNN can use a standard BLAS library for GEMM operations. The ``ONEDNN_BLAS_VENDOR`` build option controls BLAS library selection, and defaults to ``NONE``. For AArch64 builds with GCC, use the `Arm Performance Libraries <https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/server-and-hpc/downloads/arm-performance-libraries>`__ :

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_BLAS_VENDOR=ARMPL ..

Additional options available for development/debug purposes. These options are subject to change without notice, see https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/blob/master/cmake/options.cmake for details.

GPU Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

Intel Processor Graphics is supported by oneDNN GPU engine. GPU engine is disabled in the default build configuration.

Runtimes
--------

To enable GPU support you need to specify the GPU runtime by setting ``ONEDNN_GPU_RUNTIME`` CMake option. The default value is ``"NONE"`` which corresponds to no GPU support in the library.

OpenCL\*
++++++++

OpenCL runtime requires Intel(R) SDK for OpenCL\* applications. You can explicitly specify the path to the SDK using ``-DOPENCLROOT`` CMake option.

.. ref-code-block:: cpp

	$ cmake -DONEDNN_GPU_RUNTIME=OCL -DOPENCLROOT=/path/to/opencl/sdk ..

Graph component limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The graph component can be enabled via the build option ``ONEDNN_BUILD_GRAPH``. But the build option does not work with some values of other build options. Specifying the options and values simultaneously in one build will lead to a CMake error.
