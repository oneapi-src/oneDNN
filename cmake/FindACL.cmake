#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
#   ACL_FOUND          - True if ACL was found
#   ACL_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for ACL
#   ACL_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use ACL
#
# The module will also define two cache variables:
#
#   ACL_INCLUDE_DIR    - the ACL include directory
#   ACL_LIBRARY        - the path to the ACL library
#

# Use ACL_ROOT_DIR environment variable to find the library and headers
