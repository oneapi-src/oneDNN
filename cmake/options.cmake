      the compiler to generate the code for the processors that support SSE4.1
      instructions. This option would not allow to run the library on older
      architectures.

    - For GNU* Compiler Collection and Clang, the default option is `-msse4.1` which
      behaves similarly to the description above.

    - For all other cases there are no special optimizations flags.
