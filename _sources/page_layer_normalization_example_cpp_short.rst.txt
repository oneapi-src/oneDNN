This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Layer normalization <doxid-dev_guide_layer_normalization>` primitive in forward propagation mode.

This C++ API example demonstrates how to create and execute a :ref:`Layer normalization <doxid-dev_guide_layer_normalization>` primitive in forward propagation mode.

Key optimizations included in this example:

* In-place primitive execution;

* Creation of memory objects using the primitive descriptor.
